System Description and Use for Company:

Organisational Structure:
The employees involved in reporting and resolving faults in this generic software company can be categorized as follows:
1. Help desk staff
2. Manager
3. Developer
4. Administrator

Job Descriptions:
- Help desk employees enter and maintain general information about customers and report faults.
- The manager assigns reported faults to developers.
- Developers report to the manager and are responsible for resolving/closing faults.
- The administrator oversees the overall system administration.

System Requirements:
Customers can report faults either by calling the help desk or accessing the FRS through the web with a current account. Fault details are entered by help desk employees for phone-reported issues. For web-reported faults, help desk employees may need to contact customers for missing details.

The FRS records information about each fault, including the date reported, the customer, resolution date, fault priority, and a history description. Faults are categorized into Documentation Fault, New Feature Specification, and Genuine Fault. Each fault is assigned to a developer by their manager, and only developers can resolve and close faults.

The system produces the following reports:
1. A list of open faults assigned to a particular employee.
2. A list of resolved (closed) faults assigned to a particular employee.
3. A list of all faults recorded on a particular software product.
4. A list of all open (unresolved) faults.
5. A list of all closed (resolved) faults.
6. A list of developers assigned to each manager, indicating the number of assigned but open faults.

The system includes forms for data entry and updating. Users should have accounts limiting their access to necessary system areas. The program offers an Exit option on the menu and a logon screen differentiating between users, ensuring access corresponds to their roles in the system. Developers can only have access to faults assigned to them, and different user types can only perform functions relevant to their roles.
